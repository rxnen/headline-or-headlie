# Headline or Headlie

## Overview
**Headline or Headlie** is a daily web-based game that challenges players to guess whether five headlines are real or generated by AI. Similar to *Wordle*, players are given a set of five headlines each day and must determine whether they are authentic news stories or fabricated by AI. 

Players have one chance per day to try their hand at guessing. The goal is to guess correctly and have fun learning how AI can mimic real-world headlines.

## How to Play
1. **Guess**: Each day, you are presented with five headlines. Your task is to guess whether each headline is real or AI-generated.
3. **Daily Challenge**: You can only play once per day. Every 24 hours, a new set of five headlines will be presented to you.

## Getting Started
